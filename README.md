# AutoJD ⚡

Tired of sending the same generic job application email to every company? AutoJD helps you write personalized emails in seconds.

## The Problem 🎯

Job hunting means writing dozens of application emails. Most people either:
- Send the same boring template to everyone
- Spend 15+ minutes crafting each email manually
- Miss important keywords from the job posting

This wastes time and hurts your chances of getting noticed.

## The Solution ✨

AutoJD reads your resume and the job description, then writes a short, relevant email that actually matches what they're looking for.

Takes 30 seconds instead of 15 minutes.

## How It Works 🚀

1. Paste your resume or LinkedIn profile
2. Paste the job posting
3. Pick your tone (professional, casual, confident)
4. Get your personalized email
5. Copy and send

No account needed. Your data stays private.
